## SmartPointer
In this project, I made my own smart pointer type. I wrote a class to develop a referenced counted smart pointer, and also implemented a few other member functions to resemble the functionality of an ordinary raw pointer. Basically, this is a problem of designing a single, non-trivial class and overloading a few pointer related operators.
